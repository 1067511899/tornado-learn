'''
Your task is to define a function that understands basic mathematical expressions and solves them. For example:

calculate("1 + 1")        # => 2
calculate("18 + 4*6")     # => 42
calculate("245 - 826")    # => -581
calculate("09 + 000482")  # => 491
calculate("8 / 4 + 6")    # => 8
calculate("5 + 1 / 5")    # => 5.2
calculate("1+2+3")        # => 6
calculate("9 /3 + 12/ 6") # => 5
Notes:
Input string will contain numbers (may be integers and floats) and arithmetic operations.
Input string may contain spaces, and all space characters should be ignored.
Operations that will be used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
Operations must be done in the order of operations: First multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction.
In this kata, input expression will not have negative numbers. (ex: "-4 + 5")
If output is an integer, return as integer. Else return as float.
If input string is empty, contains letters, has a wrong syntax, contains division by zero or is not a string, return False.
