'''
You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

next_bigger(12)==21
next_bigger(513)==531
next_bigger(2017)==2071
If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

next_bigger(9)==-1
next_bigger(111)==-1
next_bigger(531)==-1

def next_bigger(n):
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pass
